// We have a MCalculate class as follows:

// public class MCalculate
// {
// public void calculation (intz)
//   }
// double m;
// m =z ^9;

// System.out.println("m"+m);
//     }
// }
// Write a Java class named OneCalculate that inherits the above MCalculate class but overrides

// calculation method. in calculation method, calculate m as -âˆš72+62 and then print the value of m. in main method of OneCalculate class, read an integer value of z and call calculation method to find the value of m.

// Write a Java program that prints the multiplication of 3 numbers by creating a class named SomeMutiplication having two same named findMul methods. One findMul method takes 3 integer numbers as parameters and return the multiplication of those 3 integer numbers. The other findMul method takes 3 double numbers as parameters and return the multiplication of those 3 double numbers. Your program should read the 3 integer numbers and pass these 3 integer numbers as parameters of findMul method. Then your program should also read the 3 double numbers and pass these 3 double numbers as parameters of findMul method.

// Write a Java program that prints the area and perimeter of a triangle by creating a class named 5 OneTrangle, having two methods named your Area and yourPerimeter that retum the area and the perimeter of the triangle respectively. Your program should read the 3 integer numbers as sides of the triangle and then pass these 3 integer numbers as parameters of a constructor.

// Rewrite the following Java program with correct syntax

// File name West.java

// package west public class West private static intz-east(): private Static int b

// b=z*41;

// public static int east()

// ( return 21.4;

// public void main(String[] args)

// System.out.printin('z is "+z) System.out.printin(bis "+b):
